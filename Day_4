#task1- learnt how to use random module

import random
head_or_tail=random.randint(0,1)

if head_or_tail==1:
    print("Heads")
else:
    print("Tails")
    
#task2- learnt to split the string of list and extract a random string using randit function which helps in understanding concepts of indexing

import random
# Split string method
names_string = input("Give me everybody's names, separated by comma. ")
names = names_string.split(", ")
# 🚨 Don't change the code above 👆

#Write your code below this line 👇
len_names= len(names)
random_choice= random.randint(0,len_names-1)
person_who_will_pay = names[random_choice] #creating a list
print(person_who_will_pay+ " is going to buy meal today!")

#using choice function
person_who_will_pay = random.choice(names)
print(person_who_will_pay+ " is going to buy meal today!")

#task3- learnt about nested lists , built a treassure map in which i learnt printing a specific symbol in a position!

row1 = ["⬜️","️⬜️","️⬜️"]
row2 = ["⬜️","⬜️","️⬜️"]
row3 = ["⬜️️","⬜️️","⬜️️"]
map = [row1, row2, row3]
print(f"{row1}\n{row2}\n{row3}")
position = input("Where do you want to put the treasure? ")
# 🚨 Don't change the code above 👆

#Write your code below this row 👇
first_digit=int(position[0]) #row index is assigned

second_digit=int(position[1]) #column index is assigned
map[second_digit-1][first_digit-1]="x" 

#Write your code above this row 👆

# 🚨 Don't change the code below 👇
print(f"{row1}\n{row2}\n{row3}")


#task 4 - rock,paper and scissors !! This project helped in understanding how random functions generate in everday softwares!
